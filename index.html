Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this questionnaire is to help the audience decide if they are hungry, or if they are falling into the all too familiar grasp of boredom. 
It is meant to prompt the audience to self-evalutate (not concretely diagnose) and to be taken for fun and the results to be taken lightly. It is not intended to advise for or against food consumption.
 
Known Issues:
This code cannot accurately determine whether a person is hungry or not, and is not meant to be used as a diagnostic tool.
The code is effective, but it is simple. The results are displayed in percentages, rather than a concrete yes or no answer. 
Sometimes the meme on the first page does not load correctly.
